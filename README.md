Electronic modules made for Arduino

## Introduction
Here you can find the public modules I made for my Arduino projects. You can re-use the schematics and PBC-layouts freely and use services such as EasyEDA and JLCPCB to order your own modules.

## Development modules

### 03. TinyDev development board for ATtiny44A/84/841
Small development board for using an ATtiny44A or similar 14-pin ATtiny in SMD package on a breadboard. Minimal hardware design featuring only MCU, breadboard friendly headers with extra power lines, ISP header for serial programming and reset button. Uses bare chip and limited extra components. Also usable for ATtiny84, ATtiny441 and ATtiny841.
